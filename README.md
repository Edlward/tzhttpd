This is the latest HTTP Service Framework I extracted from the projects I developed.    
I found it is a tedious and heavy task to manage and synchronize the http service code among serival projects, so extract the same code constructing shared libraries, manage and reference them through Git's submodule tool out-of-box is a smart choice.
